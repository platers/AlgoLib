# AlgoLib

This is an unofficial algorithm library for the UofT ICPC club.
We aspire to keep the algorithms here useful, short, fast enough and readable.


## Contribution

To add new algorithms, open a pull request with a single commit for each algorithm. Your coding style must follow the directions below.
To fix a bug or edit an algorithm for whatever reason, open a pull request with a single commit containing your changes.


## Coding style

Each algorithm should contains a header with a description of the algorithm, the problem(s) it was tested on, source and time complexity.
The only macros/typedefs used should be the ones defined in "template.cpp", unless they're specific to the algorithm.
Use tabs for indentation.
Do not include the main function or the macros/typedefs defined in "template.cpp". 
Look [here](https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl/blob/master/content/various/LIS.h) for an example.
